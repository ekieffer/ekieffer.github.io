The Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science (BINFO) offers a practice-oriented study program that provides the necessary professional skills to enter the job market after graduation, be it in the public or private sector. Ant Colony Algorithms are famous Artificial Intelligence algorithms based on the concept of Swarm Intelligence (SI) which relies on decentrilized and self-organized sytems. Such systems are composed of entities with no complex and local behaviours. However, the combination of such entities lead to "Emergence", i.e. a complex and global behaviour. Examples in natural systems of SI include ant colonies, bird flocking, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.
The Ant Colony System lecture gives insight to students about the Swarm Intelligent mechanism. In addition, students are involved in a short-term project based on a Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm in order to tackle NP-hard optimization problems
