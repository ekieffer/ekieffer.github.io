I’m a passionate research scientist who loves modelling and solving real life problems.
My journey started with a Master in “Optimization and Algorithm (OPAL)” in which I explored Machine learning and Optimization with a big preference towards large-scale decomposition algorithms for problems that cannot be solved with a single machine.
In 2015, I embarked on my first research experience and completed my PhD in Computer Science with outstanding results. At that time, my research was dedicated to Bi-level Optimization Problems (e.g., pricing problems, planning problems, defense/interdiction problems, structural design Problems, etc.)
In 2019, I had the chance to see the other especially important aspect of solving large-scale problems: High-Performance Computing. Another fascinating discipline at the intersection of optimization and data science :)
Don't hesitate to contact me, I'm always looking forward to taking on new challenges.

I also received my :

* Bachelor Degree in “Informatique” (Computer Science) in 2012

* Technology University degree in “Statistique et Informatique Décisionnelle” (Business-Intelligence) in 2011

In 2016, I obtained the certificate “Smart ICT for Business Innovation” from the University of Luxembourg.

My primary research interests include mathematical optimization, evolutionary computing and data-mining.
