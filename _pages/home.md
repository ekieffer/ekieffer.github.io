I am currently research scientist at the University of Luxembourg. I completed my PhD (oustanding) titled “Co-evolutionary Hybrid Bi-level Optimization” at the University of Luxembourg in the Parallel Computing & Optimization Group. My PhD researches were dedicated to the design and resolution of bi-level optimization problems.
Prior to that I completed a Master’s in Computer Science with first class honors at the University of Lorraine.

I also received my :

* Master Degree in “Informatique et Décision” (Decision-Support Computing) in 2014

* Bachelor Degree in “Informatique” (Computer Science) in 2012

* Technology University degree in “Statistique et Informatique Décisionnelle” (Business-Intelligence) in 2011

In 2016, I obtained the certificate “Smart ICT for Business Innovation” from the University of Luxembourg.

My primary research interests include mathematical optimization, evolutionary computing and data-mining.
