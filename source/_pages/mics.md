This master in Information and Computer Sciences is the direct continuation of the bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science. Its goal is to provide the necessary background of 5 different profiles to students:

1. Ant Systems
2. Ant Colony systems
3. Stigmergy notion
4. Emergence notion
5. Heterarchy notion

The Problem solving course falls within the Intelligent Systems profile. It provides all resources for tackling decision-making problems. Students are introduced to mathematical modelling which consists in translating real needs into a mathematical model which can be evaluated through decision-aid tools or mathematical solver. In addition to these mathematical background (e.g. combinatorial optimization, linear optimization), students are initiated to Nature Inspired Computing (e.g. Evolutionary Computation). Among the several practical sessions, students are also asked to work on a short-term project. After the course completion, a final exam allows the teaching team to re-evaluate the course each year.
